I have been thinking a lot about how to make video chat better. I spend a lot of time hacking on video conference stuff: Software, equipment, hacks, etc. The one place I constantly get inspiration from is my friends. 

So, let's crowdsource some video chat tips and tricks. I will then put them at this website so people can learn from all of us. 

No tip is too simple, too easy or too hard. I want all the tips! Free, expensive, mind set based, etc. 

Here is a form to submit your favorite tips, tricks or hacks. Once we have a bundle, I will start publishing them. 


Thanks,
